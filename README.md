# AI Interview Coach

A Jetpack Compose Android app that runs mock interviews with an AI interviewer. Practice, get scored, improve—fast.

### Features
- Random mock interview questions (tech, behavioral, etc.)
- Speak or type answers (EditText + submit button)
- AI scores your answer (1–10) with feedback: strengths, weak spots, how to improve
- Tracks sessions: "Your turn" → "Interviewer turn" → next question
- Past sessions collapse in dropdown: shows score, date, time, weak/strong points
- Delete old sessions
- Clean UI with LazyColumn list view

### Tech Stack
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- MVVM architecture
- AI integration (Grok/Claude API)
- Room DB for session history
- State management for stable UI

### Why?
I got rejected too many times. Built this to practice English, nail interviews, and stop waiting for handouts. Now anyone can level up.

### Try it
Clone, run, answer. Feedback’s brutal but honest.
